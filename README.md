 -
 -Extract the archive and move the SDK directory to the **Code** folder and rename it to **SDKs**. 
 +In order to compile, you will need to download some thirdparty SDKs. They can be downloaded by running the *download_sdks.py* script.
 +Or on windows the *download_sdks.exe* can be used alternatively.
